The problem of load balancing in organizing a distributed network is often approached with heuristics-based solutions.
It originates naturally from the complexity of such systems, the degree to which different technologies are intervowen
into the system in its final form.

The situation gets even more complicated when there is a necessity to accomodate different algorithms of load balancing
that solve the task of designating operations onto physical nodes, and even more so when one encounters the need to
use multiple algorithms at once




A conteporary approach to simulating complex multi-agent systems relies on the concept of
behavior-based systems (BBS) \cite{mataric-1992}. The core of the concept is the idea that an
intelligent behavior of a group is an emergent phenomenon of multiple interactions of agents with
one another and an environment they exist in, along with capability of those to generalize an
experience. It implies that agents have a memory and cognitive capabilities of some
sort. This approach enables one to model a wide spectrum of systems including complex ones.
